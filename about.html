        <p>Jimmy was born in Cicero, Illinois, outside Chicago. His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). Jimmy worked for his father, who ran a general store in Cicero that eventually went under after losing money regularly to scammers. Soon afterwards, he became a scammer himself, gaining the nickname "Slippin' Jimmy" for staging "slip and fall" accidents to make quick cash. Jimmy runs into trouble with the police and Chuck returns to help but requires that Jimmy join him in Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room.</p>
        <p class="dark">Jimmy befriends Kim Wexler, an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completes his college degree and attends a correspondence law school. He passes the bar exam and hopes to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner Howard Hamlin denies Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then starts a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic Mike Ehrmantraut, a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot.</p>
        <p>Jimmy begins to use the alias "Saul Goodman", a play on the phrase "It's all good, man". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,[12] and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street.</p>
